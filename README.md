# Hydromancer Hyperliquid skill

> **Disclosure:** maintained by the Hydromancer team; the author works at Hydromancer.

An [Agent Skill](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills) that teaches coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and others that read `SKILL.md`) how to use Hyperliquid data from [Hydromancer](https://hydromancer.xyz):

- **REST API** (`POST /info`): positions for one or up to 1,000 wallets per request, orders, fills with cursor paging, funding, liquidations, oracle and mark prices, candles, vaults, staking, builder-code data, PnL, HIP-3 and HIP-4 markets.
- **WebSocket streams**: trades, fills, liquidations, BBO, L2 and L4 order books, TP/SL, funding, user and builder events, with session replay after reconnects.
- **Reservoir**: historical Hyperliquid data (fills, 1-second candles, daily snapshots, 1-minute L2 books) as Parquet on AWS S3; requester-pays, so AWS bills your account for requests and transfer.

## Install

Claude Code, as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add joshavenue/hydromancer-skills
/plugin install hydromancer-hyperliquid@hydromancer
```

Or as a personal skill:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joshavenue/hydromancer-skills.git ~/.claude/skills/hydromancer-hyperliquid
```

Or per project: copy the folder into `.claude/skills/hydromancer-hyperliquid/`. Other agents: point them at `SKILL.md`; the `references/` files load on demand.

## Requirements

- A Hydromancer API key in `HYDROMANCER_API_KEY` ([how to get one](https://docs.hydromancer.xyz/readme/get-api-keys)).
- Python 3.9+ for `scripts/hydromancer.py` (standard library only). `scripts/stream_trades.py` needs `websockets`. Tested versions are pinned in `requirements.txt` (and the optional SDK, by commit, in `requirements-sdk.txt`); install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (add `-r requirements-sdk.txt` for the SDK).
- AWS credentials for Reservoir (the bucket is requester-pays; no Hydromancer key needed).
